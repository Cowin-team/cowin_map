# JS Source files

All JS source files are to be in this directory.
These are the files that developers edit.

We use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to bundle all these Javascript
files into final Javascript bundles that are included in the HTML.

Webpack is configured to take the JS files from `entrypoints` directory,
bundles them as individual files and put them in the `dist` directory.

# Development

We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com)
for development and deployment.

## Pre-requisites

* Docker
* docker-compose

## Usage

Start the server with
```
$ docker-compose up site
```

and visit http://localhost:4000

As you edit the file, the site will be regenerated automatically.
